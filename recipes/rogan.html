        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rogan Josh is a fragrant and flavorful curry that originated in Kashmir
           and has become one of the most celebrated dishes of Indian cuisine.
            Traditionally made with tender pieces of lamb or mutton, it is slow 
            cooked in a rich, aromatic sauce infused with spices such as cardamom, 
            cloves, cinnamon, and Kashmiri red chili, which gives the dish its deep
             red color without being overwhelmingly spicy. The name Rogan Josh 
            comes from Persian, where rogan means oil or clarified butter and josh
             means intense heat or passion, reflecting its vibrant appearance and 
            bold taste. Often finished with yogurt for creaminess and garnished with 
            fresh herbs, Rogan Josh pairs perfectly with steamed basmati rice 
            or naan, making it a comforting yet elegant dish enjoyed both at home and in festive meals.</p>
